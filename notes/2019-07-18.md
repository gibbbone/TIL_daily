### Catch warnings
Tag: *python*

You should always consider warnings but if you get annoyed and want to just go on with your work without minding some non-critical bugs here's how to catch them.

Specific function only:
```python
import warnings
with warnings.catch_warnings():
	warnings.simplefilter("ignore")
    fig.tight_layout()
```

Specific type of warning from specific module:
```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=UserWarning, module="matplotlib")
```
