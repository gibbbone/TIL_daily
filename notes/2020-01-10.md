		- create notes and personal subfolder in the target folder (X)
		- git init in the target folder (X)
		- make postit.sh read the config file (X)		
	- -u switch
		- ask for target folder (X)
		- ask to save in bin (X)
		- ask for git init (in case you want to use a specific upstream folder) (X)

- -p personal flag
	- notes are posted in a separate folder (X)
	- separate folder commits to a separate branch and is never pushed upstream (X)
		- separate gitignore for separate branches (X)
