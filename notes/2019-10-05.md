### Fork and track a Github repo
Tag: git

You have cloned a repo and tried it. Then you have made some changes to it locally. Afterward you decide to start pushing your changes to a personal remote repo without doing pull requests. 

So you fork the original and do the following in the cloned folder:
```bash
# Delete or rename the old origin
# git remote remove origin
git remote rename origin old-origin 
# Add a new origin 
git remote add origin <url of your new remote repo>
# Add the new origin as upstream
git push --all --set-upstream origin
# Check everything
git remote show origin
```

Now you can start to commit to your new forked repo syncing the local folder with the remote.
