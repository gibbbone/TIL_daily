### List running notebooks and kill them
Tag: *jupyter*, *python*

To list all running notebooks use:
```bash
jupyter notebook list
```
This will show running servers and their ports.  To kill them:
```bash
jupyter notebook stop <port> 
```
However on Windows an error may occur if notebooks have been closed erroneously. Firt thing to do is to restart the computer and try again. If that fails the brute force option is to remove all temporary files in the Jupyter Runtime folder [1].

Find the runtime folder:
```
jupyter --paths
``` 
`cd` to it and remove everything with fire. After that the `list` command should return empty. If not follow the other steps in Github discussion (not tested here)
