### Launch Chrome with no URL bar
Tag: *oneliner*, *cmd*

This will launch Prime in a separate window:
```powershell
chrome.exe --app=https://www.primevideo.com
```

If you want to change its icon create a shortcut to the batch file and then change its icon in the settings. You can convert any image to icon and use it.

### Script to convert set of images to ico format
Tag: *bash*, *imagemagick*

Big icons, but still not perfect:
```bash
for im in $(ls *png); do  
	convert $im -define icon:auto-resize=256,128,64,48,32,16 ico/${im/%.png/.ico}; 
done
```

For the moment I will use this [1]
