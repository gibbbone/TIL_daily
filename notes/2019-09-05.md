### Store a command from bash history providing its line number
Tag: bash, script

```bash
#!/bin/bash -i
target_file="/home/gibbone/bin/useful_oneliners.txt"
new_line=$(history | grep "^ $1")
echo ${new_line##*[1-9] } >> $target_file
```

Explanation:
- `#!/bin/bash -i` : use interactive shell, this is crucial [1]
- `target_file="/home/gibbone/bin/useful_oneliners.txt"` : select a file to store the commands
- `new_line=$(history | grep "^ $1")` : grep history for the specific line. Keep in mind that history lines start with an empty space.
- `echo ${new_line##*[1-9] } >> $target_file` : trim the history line from the line number via string substitution and append it to the target file


TODO: 
- version control the oneliners file
- add comment lines
- store simple commands without line number
