### Store a command from bash history providing its line number
Tag: bash, script

```bash
#!/bin/bash -i
while getopts ':c:l:' flag; do
	case "${flag}" in
	    c) comment=${OPTARG};;
        l) line=${OPTARG};;
        *) echo "Option not recognized"; exit 1;;
    esac
done
shift $(($OPTIND - 1))
if [[ -z "$line" ]]; then
	line=$1
fi
target_file="/home/gibbone/bin/useful_oneliners.txt"
new_line=$(history | grep "^ $line" | cut -d' ' -f4-)
if [[ -n "$comment" ]]; then
    echo "# $comment" >> $target_file
fi
echo $new_line >> $target_file
```

Explanation:
- `#!/bin/bash -i` : use interactive shell, this is crucial [1]
- command line arguments: 
	- `-c`: provide a comment string to put before the appended line
	- `-l`: provide the line as argument (this is redundant but useful)
- `target_file="/home/gibbone/bin/useful_oneliners.txt"` : select a file to store the commands
- `new_line=$(history | grep "^ $line" | cut -d' ' -f4-)` : grep history for the specific line. Keep in mind that history lines start with an empty space. Use cut to split by space (`d' '`) and select from the 4th element on.
- `echo $new_line >> $target_file` : append the trimmed history line to the target file

TODO: 
- check version control of the oneliners file
- store simple commands without line number
