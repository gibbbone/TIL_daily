### Open micro editor on the last line
Tag: *micro* 

Micro text editor can be openend on a specific line with a particular argument:
```bash
micro myfile.md:35
```
This can be "abused" to open it on the last line by using [1]:
```bash
micro myfile.md:10000
```
Obviously this won't work with files with more than 10000 lines.

### Select only specific commits for a pull request
Tag: *git*

Let's start with the common regular case.

```
A - B - C [master]
         \
          D - E - F - G [feature] 
```

You're working on a project, you use a separate branch (`feature`) for your committed changes (`D-E-F-G`) and you want to create a pull request. However you want only some of the commits to be included in the pull request (`E` and `F`)

Here's how to do it. First obtain the hashes of your commits. Here I'm piping the last 5 to `head` in order to copy them [1]:
```bash
git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit | head -5
```
Then do the following [2]:
```bash
# optional: set upstream as remote if it's not
git remote add upstream https://github.com/upstream_github_username/upstream_github_repo_name.git
# fetch changes
git fetch --all
# create specific branch for your partial pull request
git checkout -b partial-change upstream/master
```

Now this is how it looks:
```bash
          [partial-change]
A - B - C [master]
         \
          D - E - F - G [feature]
```

Cherry-pick your specific commits and push the changes:
```bash
git cherry-pick <hash of commit E>
git cherry-pick <hash of commit F>
git push -u origin partial-change
```

After fixing any conflict this is where you'll get [3]:
```bash
          E1 - F1 [partial-change]
         / 
A - B - C [master]
         \
          D - E - F - G [feature]
```

Notice that if instead you just want to apply all the consecutive commits up to the last one (or two or three) you can just branch out at the specific commit. For instance here I just want the commits up to `E` and not the subsequent ones: 
```bash 
git checkout -b partial-consecutive-changes <hash of commit E>

A - B - C [master]
         \
          D - E [partial-consecutive-changes]
               \
                F - G [feature]
```

The same procedure can help you if you just applied consecutive changes to master without using a specific branch for them and now you want to cherry-pick them after. This is relevant if you've forked a project at `C` and proceeded on master with the other commits (here I am adding an asterisk to signal that new changes are happening on the fork):
```bash
git checkout -b partial-consecutive-changes <hash of commit E>

A - B - C - D* - E* - F* -G* [master]
                  \
              D* - E* [partial-consecutive-changes]               
               
```

In this case trying to branch out the master at `G*` and cherry picking the previous commits will get you the warning *"The previous cherry-pick is now empty, possibly due to conflict resolution."* which signals that you're adding the same commits on the new branch.

### Delete branches on Git

Tag: *git*

```bash
# delete remote branch
git push --delete <remote_name> <branch_name>
# delete local branch
git branch -d <branch_name>
```

The `-d` option is an alias for `--delete`, which only deletes the branch if it has already been fully merged in its upstream branch. You could also use `-D`, which is an alias for `--delete --force`, which deletes the branch "irrespective of its merged status."[1]
