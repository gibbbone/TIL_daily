### Monkey patch a pre-loaded module
Tag: python

If you modify a module and you want to reimport it, you must take care of all the places from where you have previously imported it. Hence you will probably fail. Better delete any references to it and reimport it again. I.e.:

```python
for mod in sys.modules.keys(): 
    if mod.startswith('mymodule.mysubmodule'): 
        del(sys.modules[mod]) 

import mymodule.mysubmodule
```
