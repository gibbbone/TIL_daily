### I heard rumors of the Tab vs. Spaces war
Tag:*bash, python, markdown, opinions*

If like me you've never found the time to follow the Tab vs Space debate you probably have started using the same coding convention for every project without caring about the rest of the world and now the issue is starting to bite your ass. In my case I noticed that the bash script in yesterday note behaves differently than the python script.

Since again I don't have time to care about the issue what I understood about it is that tab and spaces are formatted differently and tabs can have problem on some computer and render differently. 

From my point of view is just a matter of comfort: one stroke vs 4 strokes. But I probably am wrong and there must be some configuration setting that could switch tabs to 4 spaces without batting an eye. 

However: here's [1] a more serious point of view about *usability*. In the comment several suggestions are made and I discovered Editorconfig [2] which is a file to define the formatting of your code so that IDE don't get crazy. Moreover it can inform also how Github render your code [3].

This is to say that I still havent found the solution to my problem but it's not really important. 

P.S. about conventions and PITAs: if nobody told you about PEPs or Tab vs Spaces you may find yourself coding in a totally different way with respect to the rest of the community [4]

### Tab vs Space: the nuclear option
Tag:*bash*

My first thought actually was to replace every tab in my notes with four spaces with a bash command. I didn't do it, but here's what I'll try the next time (*warning: not tested*)

*Below is a cut and paste of this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43523362/6332373) that I liked. *


Collecting the best comments from [Gene's answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11094620/1147688), the best solution by far, is by using `sponge` from [moreutils](https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/). 

```bash
sudo apt-get install moreutils
# The complete one-liner:
find ./ -iname '*.java' -type f -exec bash -c 'expand -t 4 "$0" | sponge "$0"' {} \;
```

**Explanation:** 

- `./` is recursively searching from current directory
- `-iname` is a case insensitive match (for both `*.java` and `*.JAVA` likes)
- `type -f` finds only regular files (no directories, binaries or symlinks)
- `-exec bash -c` execute following commands in a subshell for each file name, `{}`
- `expand -t 4` expands all TABs to 4 spaces
- `sponge` soak up standard input (from `expand`) and write to a file (the same one)*. 

**NOTE**: * A simple file redirection (`> "$0"`) won't work here because [it would overwrite the file too soon](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29244408/1088580) .

**Advantage**: All original file permissions are retained and no intermediate `tmp` files are used.
