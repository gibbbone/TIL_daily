# TODO
- add CLI arguments to
	- just modify today note (i.e without adding another one) `[X]`
	- open last note in a markdown viewer `[X]`
		- work only on Windows for the moment
	- git shortcut: merge + add + commit + push `[X]` 
- set execution attributes of the bash command `[X]`

- `n` : open note from n days before
- `-s` : "simple mode", do not add a full post but just a new section to add notes fastly
- `cat`ing from terminal to the script

# TODO long run
- how to stitch together different markdown files?
	- a for loop with cat?
		- must respect order: easy with dates
	- `mdmerge`
- configuration:
	- set starting folder
	- set editor of choice
- Rewrite everything as a prompt_toolkit app (probably too ambitious)
